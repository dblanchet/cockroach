Screenshots has been taken with the following configuration:

 - Kinect is laying down on the floor.
 - Kinect tilting is in middle position (no tilt).
 - The floor is made of tiled fitted carpet.
 - Each tile is about 50x50 cm.
 - The Kinect webcam lense is placed on a tile corner.
 - Two small yellow blocks are placed on tile corners too.

From above, it looks like this:

    |               |               |
-   +   -   -   -   K <- Kinect -   +   -
    |               |               |
    |               |               |
    |               |               |
    |               |               |
    |               |               |
-   +   -   -   -   +   -   -   -   +   -
    |               |               |
    |               |               |
    |               |               |
    |               |               |
    |               |               |
-   L <- Yellow -   C   - Yellow -> R   -
    |               |               |

The K-C distance is about 1 meter and L-R distance is about 1 meter too.
